The following code can be used to spawn a new mini and add it into the saving process:
```
            CreatureDataV1 creatureDataV1 = new CreatureDataV1(*baseMiniNGuid*);
            creatureDataV1.CreatureId = new CreatureGuid(new Bounce.Unmanaged.NGuid(System.Guid.NewGuid()));

            CreatureDataV2 creatureDataV2 = new CreatureDataV2(creatureDataV1);
            creatureDataV2.CreatureId = creatureDataV1.CreatureId;

            CreatureManager.CreateAndAddNewCreature(creatureDataV2, position, Quaternion.Euler(0, 0, 0), false, true);
```
Where *baseMiniNGuid* is the NGuid associated with the asset you are trying to spawn and can be looked up from the AssetDB.

The following code can be used to look up a Nguid based on content name;

```
        private static NGuid FindAsset(string contentName)
        {
            foreach ((AssetDb.DbEntry.EntryKind, List<AssetDb.DbGroup>) kind in AssetDb.GetAllGroups())
            {
                foreach (AssetDb.DbGroup group in kind.Item2)
                {
                    foreach (AssetDb.DbEntry item in group.Entries)
                    {
                        if (item.Name == contentName) { return item.Id; }
                    }
                }
            }
            return NGuid.Empty;
        }
```
