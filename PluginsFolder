#Plugins Folder

If a plugin needs to access the BepInEx plugins folder (typically because it is searching if certain other plugins are installed or assets are installed)
the folder can be obtained by

C#```
BepInEx.Paths.PluginPath
```
The BepInEx.Paths class has many different paths for things like the plugins folder, cache folder, executing assembly folder and so on.
